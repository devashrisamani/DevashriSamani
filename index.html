                    During the initial design exploration phase of our collaborative design computing 
                    team project, each student was assigned the task of generating inspirational ideas 
                    for the project's future development. The primary objective was to create an extensive 
                    pool of ideas that could potentially reveal themes and connections to drive the 
                    development of various design computing projects. I undertook my individual 
                    contribution by thoroughly researching multiple datasets available on <a href="https://data.gov.au/">data.gov.au.</a> However, I encountered challenges when attempting to link these datasets with an API. 
                    I delved into their contents and particularly focused on the columns to understand 
                    how we could leverage the dataset. This analysis was complemented by competitor 
                    research, which included studying existing applications such 
                    as Britannica's "Today in History" and "History at a Glance." These applications 
                    provided valuable insights into how historical data could be effectively utilized. 
                    Additionally, I explored the puzzle API to gain insights into utilizing JavaScript 
                    effectively. To validate the concept, I sought feedback from the workshop tutors. 
                    While they suggested creating something that could be used for job applications in the future, it proved unfeasible 
                    due to dataset restrictions. Finally, using Figma, I created a low-fidelity prototype of the 
                    homepage, which subsequently became the final idea for the team's 
                    development project.

                <div class="desc">
                    While bulding the concept and the poster, I struggled with the datasets and API. It took some
                    getting used to, however the Tutors were very helpful to guide me in the right direction.
                    Moreover, this phase helped me understand the value of critial thinking and refelction.
                    The feedback on this poster presentation was an eye-opener about the expectations 
                    of the future phases. I was able to think more critically and focus on singular 
                    design considerations. This phase also helped me develop my presentation skills.

                        To set our project goals, we conducted a deep background 
                        research on Australia's history class education and gamification 
                        in education. Based on the research and project goals we made corresponding 
                        feature considerations. This was followed by identifying challenges and user needs, 
                        building personas and finally, designing the wireframes.

                        My contributions toward this phase included conceptualisation of the idea, 
                        proposing a design and creating paper sketches. Moreover, the team was 
                        a little hesitant in the beginning to conduct desk-research. However, 
                        I was able to convince them that having a strong research foundation and 
                        competitor analysis is really important for any design and development project.
                        I further expplored History related game applications by downloading them on my 
                        phone and noting down the features on our Miro board.
                        Moreover, I contributed towards building the User Persona as well. 
                        Lastly, I helped with refining the presentation slides for this phase
                        by carefully highlighting the rubric requirements to my team, 
                        proofreading the content on the slides as well as 
                        helping with minor design changes as I was not fully satisfied with the 
                        slides at first.

                                Upon reviewing the Australian curriculum, specifically the content descriptions and achievement 
                                standards for students in years 9 and 10 , it's clear that they should be exposed to World War I 
                                events, the Australian wartime experience, and the importance of the Anzac legend. However, historical 
                                knowledge can be dense, and traditional classroom teaching methods can be uninteresting and overwhelming 
                                for high school students, inundating them with excessive information.

                                A history education study conducted by Western Sydney University involved surveying 700 Australian 
                                students aged 12 to 18 (Hyland, 2023). The results showed that about two-thirds of these students did 
                                not feel a connection to certain historical events, such as those related to the Anzacs or the 
                                Federation (Hyland, 2023). Many students perceived Anzac history as irrelevant to their lives, 
                                despite having basic knowledge of World War I acquired through school. The lack of engagement and 
                                interest stemmed from the perception that these historical events occurred a long time ago and seemed 
                                distant from their contemporary lives (Hyland, 2023).
                                Notably, some research has indicated an ongoing improvement in teaching methods. Educators are 
                                increasingly integrating multimedia resources, such as newspapers, radio broadcasts, and photographs, 
                                in an effort to present content in a more appealing manner to students (Hyland, 2023).

                                gamification learning activities could spark excitement. (Moseikina, M, 2022). There is a significant 
                                increase in their learning motivation when using gamified learning methods compared to traditional education. 
                                This approach maintained their interest in the subject, encouraged active learning through social interactions
                                (Moseikina, M, 2022).  95% of students expressed  satisfaction with the learning process, finding it easy, engaging, 
                                and valuable (Moseikina, M, 2022). The pedagogical model of gamified history education, as tested by the students, 
                                has proven to be highly effective in imparting fundamental historical knowledge and fostering a professional level of 
                                historical thinking (Moseikina, M, 2022).
                                Therefore, based on the above research, our website is designed to encourage our audience to view history 
                                from a more specific and individualized perspective. They could sense the lives of South Australians on both the front 
                                lines and the home front during WWI, tangibly feeling the impact of the war on ordinary people, and recognizing the value of peace.

                              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong style="color: #3D5A94;">Initial Concept:</strong> 
                                Our initial concept is about creating a puzzle game that enables users to uncover 
                                Queensland's history by visualizing news article images and local photo stories from the 
                                past through puzzles. After users solve the puzzles, they will unlock key highlights related to 
                                the images and articles. The primary internal data source we used is from the State Library of 
                                Queensland named “The Queenslander newspaper photographs 1914-1918”. While searching for the external 
                                datasets, we were aiming to seek datasets including information on world history during 1914-1918 like WW1. 
                                Therefore, it can be combined with our internal data to help draw connections between Queensland and global 
                                historical events.</p>

                              <p><strong style="color: #3D5A94;">Purpose:</strong>
                                The primary purpose of the website is to provide a platform for young individuals to interact with their local history. 
                                Our website emerged from the observation that many existing history-related platforms, 
                                like Britannica's Today in History or applications similar to History at a Glance, 
                                often present historical information in a conventional and overwhelming manner. These platforms 
                                primarily rely on news articles, images, and data but tend to lack engaging interactions. 
                                Additionally, our research uncovered a gap in platforms providing South Australian news articles 
                                related to World War I. This gap results in young individuals, particularly those in South Australia, 
                                having limited knowledge about their region's significant contributions to World War I. 
                                Furthermore, interviews with students living in South Australia highlighted their lack of awareness 
                                regarding the region's local history and its contributions to World War I.

                                Ancestral Echoes aims to tackle these challenges by making history more interactive, particularly 
                                for the younger generation. We understand that young individuals seek entertainment through various 
                                forms, such as board games and music, and are actively engaged on social media. Traditional history 
                                textbooks often present abstract and grand narratives that feel disconnected from their daily lives, 
                                making it difficult to establish a connection.

                                    Our website is designed for individuals like Alice, young and curious, interested 
                                    in local history but struggling to find engaging ways to explore it. Traditional methods, 
                                    such as library visits, feel outdated, and knowledge from older generations is limited. 
                                    History textbooks often seem abstract and distant. Our target audience primarily consists 
                                    of young individuals, like Alice, who have a basic understanding of World War I history 
                                    but want a more immersive and entertaining way to learn. Our research highlights the need for 
                                    interactive platforms that delve into the specific details of South Australia's contributions 
                                    to World War I. We also discovered through interviews with students in South Australia that 
                                    there is a lack of awareness about local history and its role in World War I among this group.
                                    The research findings lead us to the conclusion that there is a lack of interactive platforms 
                                    that offer engaging methods for learning about the specific details of South Australia's 
                                    contributions to World War I. Additionally, we conducted interviews with students residing in 
                                    South Australia . Most of them are unaware regarding the region's local history and its role in 
                                    World War I. The following research observations helped us define the target audience and user

                                     we have envisioned a user scenario as follows: In order to complete the assignment involves 
                                     researching Australia's contributions to WW1. Alice discovers our website "Ancestral Echoes”. 
                                     After engaging with a puzzle game featuring a historical photograph, she learnt the story behind 
                                     the image. This particular image captures the Voluntary Nursing Corps in Balaklava, South Australia, 
                                     which happens to be her grandmother's hometown. This discovery forms a connection between Alice and the 
                                     history story. Eager to delve deeper into her newfound knowledge, Alice follows a link to Wikipedia, further enriching 
                                     her understanding. After all, she shares this experience on Instagram, and her peers respond with enthusiasm.

                                This research process has been significant for as it was
                                the first time my team and I worked together consistently over a few days. 
                                It took us time to get used to each others' working styles. Moreover, for me personally, 
                                working on 2C was quite a challenge as we spent hours together 
                                confused and conflicted with the research. At first, I was unable to put my 
                                point forth with the team, however, eventually through streamling the research, 
                                we could come to a final conclusion. I think the key is to do desk research and be well 
                                prepared for a reseach meeting so as to respect everyone's time and work efficiently.

                        The development process includes building the puzzle canvas 
                        and using JavaScript to define the basic fucntions of the game.

                    <p>
                        I used a variety of programmatic components which were strategically designed and implemented to provide a rich and engaging user experience for the puzzle game. 
                        Below, we elaborate on the key functions that played integral role in our project:<br>
                        <br>
                        ImageBlock Constructor: I introduced the ImageBlock constructor function to serve as the blueprint for individual jigsaw puzzle pieces. It endowed each piece with essential properties, including a unique piece number, coordinates (both X and Y), and a selection status flag. These properties formed the foundation for the interactive manipulation of puzzle pieces.<br> <br>
                        Jigsaw Constructor: At the core of our project, the Jigsaw constructor function took center stage. This function bore the responsibility of initializing the entire game. It not only configured the canvas for rendering but also orchestrated the placement of puzzle pieces and user interactions. By encapsulating these vital aspects within the Jigsaw constructor, we realized a modular and maintainable codebase.<br> <br>
                        Initialization Function: We introduced the initDrawing function to kickstart the jigsaw puzzle game. Its role was pivotal in setting up event listeners to capture user interactions, such as mouse clicks and movements. Subsequently, this function triggered the commencement of a new game session. <br> <br>
                        Preview Display Function: To provide users with a visual reference, the showPreview function was incorporated. It displayed a preview of the final puzzle image, offering users a sneak peek at the ultimate objective of the game. <br> <br>
                        Game Initialization Function: When initiating a fresh game, the initializeNewGame function came into action. This function orchestrated the arrangement of image blocks (representing puzzle pieces) and the rendering of the game grid on the canvas, thereby presenting users with a new puzzle challenge. <br> <br>
                        Position Setting Function: The setImageBlock function was essential for accurately positioning individual image blocks within the puzzle grid. It contributed significantly to the creation of a coherent puzzle layout, facilitating user engagement. <br> <br>
                        Grid Line Drawing Function: The drawLines function was responsible for visually demarcating the puzzle grid by drawing grid lines on the canvas. This feature aided users in correctly positioning the puzzle pieces. <br> <br>
                        Image Rendering Functions: Various functions were dedicated to the rendering of puzzle pieces. drawAllImages efficiently displayed all image blocks on the canvas, excluding the currently selected one. drawImageBlock focused on rendering an individual image block, particularly during user interactions. The drawFinalImage function was triggered upon puzzle completion, providing users with a clear view of the final image. <br> <br>
                        Completion Handling Function: The onFinished function was instrumental in executing actions when the puzzle was successfully completed. These actions included audio playback, board clearing, and the presentation of an information page to celebrate the user's achievement. <br> <br>
                        Board Clearing Function: When the puzzle was completed, the clearGame function efficiently cleared the game board by removing the pieces, thus preparing the canvas for a new game session.<br> <br>
                        Mouse Event Handlers: Functions such as handleOnMouseOut, handleOnMouseDown, handleOnMouseUp, and handleOnMouseMove catered to the management of user interactions. They enabled the selection, dropping, and movement of puzzle pieces, fostering a dynamic gameplay experience. <br> <br>
                        Canvas Clearing Function: To facilitate game resets and maintain a clean canvas, I introduced the clear function, which effectively wiped the canvas clean. <br> <br>
                        Random Number Generator Function: Serving as a random number generator within specified minimum and maximum value ranges. This function introduced an element of randomness into the gameplay. <br> <br>
                        Image Block Identification Functions: For precise tracking of puzzle pieces, I implemented the getImageBlock function, allowing identification based on user mouse coordinates. Additionally, the getImageBlockOnEqual function helped identify specific puzzle pieces with matching coordinates. <br> <br>
                        Completion Checker Function: The isFinished function played a pivotal role in determining whether the puzzle was successfully completed. By comparing the positions of image blocks to their target positions, it ensured that all pieces were correctly arranged. <br> <br>

                        By far, this phase was the most challenging yet productive of them all. 
                        I think I have not learnt as much JavaScript as I have through this part.
                        In the beginning, I struggled with building the coding environment on my system 
                        as I had very limited knowledge of JavaScript, game development and datasets 
                        prior to this. However, one thing that I have learned is that 
                        you really just need to start and phase the intial few difficult days and then
                        it gets easier as you start understanding the concepts better. Moreover, 
                        with regards to the team collaboration, I was unsure of the Web-Development
                        support I would receive from my fellow team mate who was responsibe for coding 
                        as we both had different expectations from the course. Eventually, I took the lead
                        and started delegating tasks, specifically individual functions to get things 
                        going. The other team mates responsible for design were were helpful and supportive 
                        in terms of helping me debug as well. We took the feedback seriously from the 
                        previous phase and worked systematically according to the rubric.

                        At this point, we were left with the CSS side of things. Moreover, this was when
                        the team came together to critically view the prototype to let me know of their
                        thoughts, improvements, and expectations. The fetching of the images using the API was
                        resolved in this phase.  
                        Aside from the regular programmig of debugging minor errors, the main task at hand
                        for me was identifying the root cause of why the API was not working to fetch the images 
                        from the dataset. Previously, I had simulated it for 2D but now, I had to make it functional. 
                        With the help of the Tutors and my teammates, it was concluded that since the images were present 
                        in the form of a URL in the dataset, I had to first sanitise it to access not only the dataset
                        but also the image URL source and download the image from there. The code snippet for the same 
                        is shown above.

                    <p>
                        Through this phase I developed slightly advanced coding aspects such as 
                        using git hub to commit the code regularly as well as using Live Share 
                        extention to cross collaboarte with the team. Previously we also struggled
                        with having the code being over-written and not having a system in place. However, 
                        this phase helped me develop an environment for collaboration. Even though it was 
                        too late into the project, I believe I will take that as a learning and make sure 
                        to have a system in place whenever starting my future projects. Through this time
                        I also got to know what it is like to work as a developer. My design team sat with me 
                        talked to me about their designs expectations and I translated their designs into CSS. 
                        With regards to the development, I leanred the iterative nature of coding projects
                        and got used to the constant cycle of code breaking and debugging.

                    <div class="desc">
                        I recognized that the layout and presentation of portfolio content played a pivotal role in the website's success. 
                        Therefore, I prioritized this aspect. I started by crafting the HTML structure and added content to provide a tangible 
                        view of what I was working with. Subsequently, I delved into the CSS to ensure that the content was presented in an 
                        easily readable manner. Moreover, I also referenced the workshop notes to further assist me with coding
                        challenges. To provide clear difference between sections of the portfolio, I meticulously designed section headers 
                        that incorporated elements such as color, fonts, and size. Reflecting on the portfolio's creation, I consider it a success. 
                        I am immensely satisfied with the final website, and I gained valuable insights during its development. 
                        If I were to consider any changes, it would be to further improve the sections and incorporate interactive elements to reduce the text on-screen. 
                        Moreover, I would also consider exploring frameworks such as Bootstrap and React. Also, I felt restricted
                        while finishing this portfolio as I did not have enough time to incorporate everything
                        into the portfolio as it also had the file-size requirements. Therefore, this portfolio has only highlighted 
                        the primary aspects of the project, especially with regards to the code. The contact form
                        is fully function as it is linked to Google Sheets using an extension, however, the function of 
                        clearing the form when it is submitted is not working.
                        Lastly, I tried includig the Readme file
                        in the code but was unsuccessful due to the constraints of time. I aim to fix these
                        issues in the future and use the portfolio for my job applications. 
                        Overall, building this portfolio
                        helped me immensely to improve my JS and CSS skills.

                <div class="desc">
                    Looking back at my initial goals mentioned in the journal, I'm delighted to observe the 
                    significant progress I made in expanding my technical knowledge. Throughout the 
                    semester, I had the opportunity to work with a variety of programming languages 
                    and tools, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and even delving into APIs. 
                    This technical growth has not only broadened my skill set but also increased my 
                    confidence as a developer. A particular source of value was the workshops, where 
                    I learned invaluable skills related to debugging, inspecting websites, and 
                    skilfully addressing bugs. These sessions allowed me to tackle coding challenges 
                    more efficiently and helped me realize the importance of utilising workshop and 
                    tutor time wisely. A larger goal that I identified during this course was the 
                    importance of attending sessions throughout the week to gradually make progress 
                    in the coding aspect of our projects. I learned that debugging can sometimes be 
                    a time-consuming process that may take weeks to resolve completely, and consistent 
                    effort was key to achieving success in this regard.

                <div class="desc">
                    On the flip side, when it comes to improving my design skills, 
                    I must acknowledge that this was an area where I had fewer opportunities 
                    for growth, primarily due to my role as a developer within the group. 
                    While I did contribute to some design decisions, especially in presentations 
                    and prototypes, I didn't have as much room to enhance my design knowledge. 
                    However, I recognise that there are future courses I can explore to further 
                    develop this aspect of my skill set. Lastly, I came to understand that critical 
                    thinking and reflection are key components of any design process. They helped me 
                    build on my project and tap into a dimension of thinking that usually goes 
                    unnoticed. In essence, this course provided me with a holistic perspective on 
                    the design and development process, and I look forward to further expanding my 
                    skills and knowledge in future courses.

                    <div class="title">Course Outcomes</div>
                <div class="desc">
                    I found this course to be quite enjoyable. 
                    The freedom to unleash our creativity was a highlight for me, 
                    and I was intrigued by the diverse directions that everyone took with their projects. 
                    However, my primary issue with the course is the extensive documentation requirements. 
                    I felt that we spent a considerable amount of time on report writing, which limited the 
                    time available for designing and creating our final product. 





                    
                </div>
                <div class="title">Course Improvements</div>
                <div class="desc">
                    Reflecting on my initial expectations and experiences throughout the course, 
                    there are several key observations and recommendations to consider. The course didn't progress well for students with prior website development 
                    experience who wanted to go beyond the basic requirements. The resistance to incorporating 
                    certain technologies limited the creative potential of some projects. It is suggested that the 
                    course should be more open to embracing innovative technologies and approaches, provided they 
                    align with the learning objectives. The course's emphasis on large-scale assessment prompted 
                    an approach within teams, where each team member experienced only a fraction of the design process. 
                    This limited the depth of learning and exploration. A recommendation is to introduce activities where each team member 
                    must present their research to the team, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of the project as a whole.
                    Another observation was the reluctance of many teams to initiate user-testing and actively seek feedback. 
                    Teams often relied on tutor-directed activities for feedback, and peer interactions were limited. Encouraging 
                    the habit of seeking feedback independently would be beneficial. In our experience, obtaining feedback from potential 
                    users significantly contributed to our project's success by helping us identify and rectify issues promptly.
                    Regarding team management, my team faced challenges with a team member who did not contribute equally to the project. 
                    The course did little to assist in addressing this issue, and the responsibility to address the problem ultimately fell 
                    on the team. It is recommended that the course implement regular peer performance evaluations to identify and address such issues earlier in the process. 
                    Placing the onus on teams to deal with poor performance in a first-year course may not be the most effective approach.
